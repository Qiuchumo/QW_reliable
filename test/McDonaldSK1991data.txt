#    shows that Tukey-Kramer method of unplanned comparisons
#    groups 
#    Newport/Magadan/Tillamook (2/4/1), 
#    Magadan/Tillamook/Tvarminne (4/1/5), 
#    and Tvarminne/Petersburg (5/3).

#    From http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statanovaplanned.html:
#    Really important note about planned comparisons
#      Planned comparisons must be planned before you look at the data. If you 
#    look at some data, pick out an interesting comparison, then analyze it as 
#    if it were a planned comparison, you will be committing scientific fraud. 
#    For example, if you look at the mean arch heights for the nine sports, see 
#    that cross-country has the lowest mean and swimming has the highest mean, 
#    then compare just those two means, your P-value will be much too low. This 
#    is because there are 36 possible pairwise comparisons in a set of 9 means. 
#    You expect 5 percent, or 1 out of 20, tests to be "significant" at the 
#    P<0.05 level, even if all the data really fit the null hypothesis, so 
#    there's a good chance that the most extreme comparison in a set of 36 
#    will have a P-value less than 0.05.
#      It would be acceptable to run a pilot experiment and plan your planned 
#    comparisons based on the results of the pilot experiment. However, if you 
#    do this you could not include the data from the pilot experiment in the 
#    analysis; you would have to limit your anova to the new data.
